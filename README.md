## 🔮 Conceptual Direction

A playful fairy-tale world infused with paranormal elements. The design combines tongue-in-cheek humor with dreamy magical visuals.

**Color Scheme**

- **Primary:** Deep purples, midnight blues, and starry blacks for a mystical night-sky environment.
- **Accent:** Neon greens, glowing whites, and pale pinks to highlight ghostly apparitions.

**Typography**

- **Primary Font:** A whimsical, slightly quirky serif that evokes magical texts.
- **Secondary Font:** A clean, playful sans-serif for readability.

**Visual Motifs**

- Subtle ghostly shapes drifting in the background.
- Sparkles, wisps of magic, and curling smoke for a mysterious feel.

- **Card Hover Effects**: Subtle bobbing or glowing edges.
